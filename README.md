# Wastes-In-Hong-Kong
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Tableau-based project focused on understanding waste production in Hong Kong. Our primary goal was to analyze and visualize the different types of waste generated in the city while observing the trends of its increase or decrease over time. Additionally, we aimed to assess the availability and effectiveness of recycling measures across various districts in Hong Kong. Through interactive Tableau visualizations, we provide valuable insights into the waste landscape of the city, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding waste management and sustainable practices.
